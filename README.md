# Project Overview
This project supports a leading global bank in identifying the 10 most attractive locations for new branch openings in Madrid and Cataluña, based on sociodemographic, business activity, and competition variables. We worked with municipality-level data and engineered relevant features—both in absolute terms (frequencies) and as population-adjusted ratios—focused on attributes of strategic interest to the bank, such as affluent individuals, professionals, and profitable businesses. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we derived variable weights to construct a composite zone score that reflects each municipality’s alignment with the bank’s ideal expansion profile. Additionally, we applied the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to uncover groups of municipalities with similar structural and commercial characteristics.

This thesis was done in collaboration with Deloitte, who have been kind enough to present us with this challenge, and who have taken on a guiding role throughout this project.
